I am currently a fourth-year undergraduate student at University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC) in School of Software Engineering, Sichuan, China.
I am devoted to making heavy models faster as well as making tiny models more accurate. My main interested research topics include (but not limited to):
  - Model acceleration for Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing and Graph Learning
  - Multi-modality Deep Learning
  - AI for good
