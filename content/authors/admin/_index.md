I am currently a fourth-year undergraduate student at University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC) in School of Software Engineering. I am devoted to Efficient Multi-modal Deep Learning, which means making heavy models faster as well as making tiny models more accurate. Now I am furthering the scientific research at [Institute for Artificial Intelligence, Peking University](https://www.ai.pku.edu.cn/), where I am advised by [Prof. Meng Li](https://www.ai.pku.edu.cn/info/1158/2309.htm).

My main interested research topics include (but not limited to):
  - Model acceleration and improvement for Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing and Graph Learning
  - Multi-modality Deep Learning
  - AI for Good
